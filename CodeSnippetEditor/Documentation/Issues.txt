Please compile the code before opening the forms designer for the first time.  
If you recieve an error when trying to open the form or control's designer then
 - close all designers
 - open the Data Sources window
 - make sure you have compiled the application
The designer should now open without error.


There appears to also be a deisgner generated code issue when binding with My.Settings.  If the runtuime fails, search for the intial type setting in the .designer.vb fiel and repalce it as follows:

Search for :
Me.MySettingsBindingSource.DataSource = GetType(System.Configuration.ApplicationSettingsBase)

Replace with :
Me.MySettingsBindingSource.DataSource = GetType(SnippetEditor.My.MySettings)
